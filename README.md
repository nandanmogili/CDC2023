Social Sciences Track:  Carolina Data Challenge 


An analysis of how the demographic of US cities has changed from 2000 to 2010. Because different areas of the country are made of different groups of people, not every place demands the same needs. We make conclusions based on this data on where it would be best to invest certain resources and allocate certain funds and services.

Included in this repository is an RMD file containing our data cleaning process in R Studio and our presentation slides.
